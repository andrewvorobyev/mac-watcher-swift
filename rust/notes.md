## Chrome Dev Tools

Starts it's own browser by default. Another instance can be used when starting MCP with `npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest --browserUrl=http://127.0.0.1:9222` but that requires chrome on 9222 to be launched with remote debugging enabled.

The started browser seems very sluggish with pages loading very slowly, scroll laging.

I.e. the browser seems unusable by the human.
